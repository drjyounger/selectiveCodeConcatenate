1. Project Overview
Goal: Assist a beginner developer to build a web application that presents a UI for local file and folder selection and then concatenates the files into one long markdown file that is easy to read. 

Because you are working with a beginner code, always be explicit and detailed about which files to change, how to change them, and where exactly the files are located.

The project is a React-based application that uses a web browser UI to select and concatenate files.

Selective File Concatenation - using a checkbox-based file directory tree navigation UI to navigate locally and select all the files that are relevant to the ticket and pull request. 
1.  Allow the user to enter a root directory path as a starting point
2.  Display the full file directory tree starting from the root directory, with checkboxes beside each file and subdirectory
3.  Allow selective checking of the boxes to include in the concatenation
4.  When checking the box beside a folder, it should include everything in that folder, including sub-folders and files
5. When "Next" is clicked, the system then concatenates all the selected files, according to the logic rules outlined in the program
6.  It should have an easy-to-use UI
